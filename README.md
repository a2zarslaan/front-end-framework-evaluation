# Front End Framework Evaluation


This is a series of 3 projects meant to compare the most popular Front-End frameworks - Vue, React and Angular. The motive is to develop the same exact website with all 3 technologies to evaluate longevity, community support, performance, bundle size, ecosystem and just intuitiveness for my personal use. The project uses bulma css library for the grid system and styling, which is a very lightweight css only library unlike bootstrap which includes javascript. Bulma has both css and sass versions and any version can be used according to the user preference. Each framework has its own branch with framework name in it.


## Vue
Vue can be installed 3 ways - NPM, Vue Cli & CDN

It is observed that Vue is a bit more simplified and straightforward framework, with moderate modularity as the components can further be broken down into smaller parts but are not. Every Vue component(.vue) contains three parts in order - the template, scripts for logic and the styles. The static elements(like header and footer) on the page are added directly to the App.vue file.


Personal Notes: While Vue does not support modularity at the lowest level, it is the easiest to setup and implement out of the 3 frameworks. The setup was very quick and straightforward, no code breaking dependencies observed. Would recommend for small to medium sized projects which do not involve tremendous complexity.
